Advantages of V-Model are:

Easy to use
Simple to use
Testing activities like planning, test designing happens well before coding.
Time saving, quick
Hence higher chance of success over the waterfall model

Disadvantages of V-Model are:

Very rigid
Least flexible
Software is developed during the implementation phase, so no early prototypes of the software are produced
If any changes happen in midway, then the test documents along with requirement documents has to be updated
Risky


Advantages of the prototyping:


users can really feel the product

Test the usability of the product to find problems

Easy to communicate with users, leaders and other relevant people

Improve the efficiency of product design


Disadvantages of the prototyping:


Time-consuming with great expense, especially when you in the tight budget.

Prototype design may constrain the designer's ideas, the more you design, the smaller space available to the designer. It may decrease the designer's enthusiasm. If you don’t require much design capability, you can’t design high fidelity prototype.

If the designer's knowledge is limited, it may not be possible to estimate the difficulty degree of implementation and will cause unlimited development time.
